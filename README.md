# Getting Started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Java compiler was developed using Java 8.

Before running the compiler, you need to install Java 8 in your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). I recommend using Linux or MacOS to run the compiler for a better experience.

1. Clone the repository following the next command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JorgeSarricolea/java_compiler
```

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE

```bash
cd java_compiler
```

3. Run all classes in the `Compiler` package

```bash
cd Compiler
javac Compiler/*.java
```

4. Run the compiler following the next command:

```bash
java Compiler.Compiler
```
